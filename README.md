# Ed Steg [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ed-cooper/EdSteg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ed-cooper/EdSteg)
An educational stenography project to hide messages within images.

This is an old project of mine that was chosen to practice the use of unsafe code within C# for image manipulation.

I have since updated it to reflect better coding practices and add unit testing with continuous integration through Travis CI.

**Note:** This project is purely educational and the encoding is neither secure nor hard to detect. Please look elsewhere if you desire this.
